I'm Anju Batta. I believe you are here because you want to know something about me, huh? I'm not good at explaining me, but yea, I've tried my best. I'm a learner. Years down the lane, I aspire to architect solutions. I don't have the patience for positioning a \"div\" on the web-page, if you ignore that, with all the critical thinking and multi-tasking I boast of, you can count me for a full-stack developer. I'm obsessed with coding, but I believe in thinking and planning before writing the code. I go mad when code isn't aligned. I like keeping the code DRY. The amount of code I punch in is directly proportional to the coffee I consume. And a little truth: I cannot survive without google and stackoverflow. .\r\n      </p>\r\n\t  <div class=\"image-block\">\r\n\t <img src={logo} alt=\"Gatsby Logo\" />\r\n\t  </div>\r\n\t  <div class=\"details\">\r\n\t   Welcome to my website.
