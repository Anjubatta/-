{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</p>\n<p>Ionic Framework is focused on the frontend user experience, or UI interaction of an app (controls, interactions, gestures, animations). It’s easy to learn, and integrates nicely with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, or can be used standalone without a frontend framework using a simple script include.</p>\n<p>Currently, Ionic Framework has official integration with Angular, but support for Vue and React are in development. If you’d like to learn more about Ionic Framework before diving in, we created a video to walk you through the basics.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-20","title":"Ionic","tags":["Ionic","angular"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.901840490797546,"src":"/static/383cd1f7afc559b582f6f75ccf8103a2/14d4d/ionic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/383cd1f7afc559b582f6f75ccf8103a2/14d4d/ionic.jpg 310w","srcWebp":"/static/383cd1f7afc559b582f6f75ccf8103a2/edcd5/ionic.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/383cd1f7afc559b582f6f75ccf8103a2/edcd5/ionic.webp 310w","sizes":"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/383cd1f7afc559b582f6f75ccf8103a2/d260a/ionic.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/-/ionic","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/-/mysql","title":"MySQL","tags":["mysql","database"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/-/bigcommerce","title":"BigCommerce","tags":["BigCommerce","cms"]}}}}
