Some people say you should start with learning Linux, other people say data scientists should be learning Scala not Python or R.</h3>\n<p>You can use Scala but if you dont don't know it yet you can start with something more friendly to you : ))</p>\n<p>Python is great &#x26; pretty easy language, I am still researching, playing around and definitely planning to dive deeper in this 'ecosystem' too. 99% its use case is in Data Science field like training the model.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/Tensorflow-docs.jpg\" alt=\"nope\"></p>\n<h3>And what about R?</h3>\n<p>It is good at mathematical modeling and thatâ€™s about it. With Python you get a lot more return on your learning investment, and can do a larger range of tasks do some cool things using it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-data-science-in-2019-50a7200f4129\">Check it out</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-become-a-machine-learning-engineer-a-cheat-sheet\">Check it out</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com\">Your Home for Data Science</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://realpython.com\">Python Tutorials</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codechalleng.es\">Learn Python From the Comfort</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18251274/ai-artificial-intelligence-tool-machine-vision-algorithms\">Google and OpenAI</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Science","date":"March 28, 2019","path":"data-science-2019","image":"/assets/datascience.jpg","tags":"#Data-Science #AI/ML #RodeMap #tensorflow","seo":"Data Science, ML, tensorflow, AI"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/data-science-2019/"}}
