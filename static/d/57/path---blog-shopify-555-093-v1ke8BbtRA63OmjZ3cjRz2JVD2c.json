{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Just over a decade ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us.</p>\n<p>We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers, along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify was born.</p>\n<p>We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can focus on what they do best: building and selling their products. Today, merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in retail stores, and on the go.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"shopify","date":"July 11, 2018","path":"shopify","image":"/assets/shopify.jpg","tags":"#shopify","seo":"shopify"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Shopify/"}}
