I'm Anju Batta. I believe you are here because you want to know something about me, huh? I'm not good at explaining me, but yea, I've tried my best. I'm a learner.

I'm obsessed with coding, but I believe in thinking and planning before writing the code. I go mad when code isn't aligned. I like keeping the code DRY. The amount of code I punch in is directly proportional to the coffee I consume.
